# Rules
1. Please put your name somewhere in your nickname. You can keep your original username in your nickname if you wish.
2. If you do not set your role in the \#rules channel within 1 day of joining you will recieve a DM from a moderator to set your role. If you still have not set your role after 3 days, you will be kicked from the server.
3. The above rule also applies to nicknames. 1 day warning, 3 days kicked.
4. Punishment for rulebreaking is at moderator discretion. Minor offenses will usually grant you a warning and/or a short mute. Major offenses will result in a temporary mute, and in more extreme cases a kick or a ban.
5. If you are kicked, you *can* rejoin the server. However, if you abuse this, __you will be banned.__
6. Be nice to each other. No profanity, and no offensive words. \(n-word, gay in a derrogatory way, etc.\)

## Rules for plugging other servers
1. Do not plug other servers. Doing so will earn you a warning.
2. Before you ask to plug a server, make sure you have permission from the server owner to share it.
3. To plug a server, post a link into the \#plug-suggestions channel. A moderator will review your server and will place an invite into the \#server-plugs channel if it is approved.
4. Do not DM a moderator asking if they can plug your server. Doing so will result in being kicked from the server.
